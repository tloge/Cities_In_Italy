Background
----------

    There are four main things that Bassano is known for: its covered 
    bridge over the Brenta, the strong grappa liqueur, the military 
    history, and the locally produced ceramics.

    The most famous landmark in Bassano is the beautiful bridge called the 
    Ponte degli Aplini. This covered wooden bridge over the Brenta river 
    was designed in 1569 to replace earlier incarnations. The bridge has 
    been rebuilt and remodeled multiple times since.
