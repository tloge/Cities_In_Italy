Special Facts about Naples
--------------------------

    Even though Naples is often overlooked by tourists due to its rumors of 
    being unsafe, it will give you the true taste of Italy - cobblestone 
    streets, authentic pizza and real Italian flavor. Naples is said to have 
    a completely different vibe than the fashionable Milan and touristy Rome 
    and Venice.

    Traditional Neapolitan cuisine is known for inventing **pizza**. Neapolitan 
    pizza even has specific rules for the type of flour, tomatoes, cheese 
    and olive oil that can be used to make it authentic. Along with pizza, 
    eggplant parmesan was first served here as well. Naples is also known 
    for its wines, decadent desserts, and limoncello, a lemon liqueur.
